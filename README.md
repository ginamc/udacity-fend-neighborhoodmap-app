# React Neighborhood Map App

This project is a culmination of all the lessons learned in the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. It assesed our abilities to create a web app using React while keeping in mind usability and accessibility, error handling, API requests, HTML and CSS, and more. This project was made completely from scratch, however, I did reference walkthroughs by coursemates to get me up and running.

_This project was done as a requirement for [Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) course._

## Start Here
To use this web app on your local machine:
- download the file or clone the repository
- run `npm install` in your console
- run `npm start` to rev up the server and load map app

Once you get the server running, you'll be able to see the web app in action.

## How to Use
This is a basic web app that shows popular food places in Bushwick (Brooklyn, NY). When you first open the app in your browser, you'll be presented with a handful of locations (marked on the map and as a list on the side).
- Clicking on a map marker will open an window with information.
- Clicking on a food place name in the side menu will open a window on the corresponding map marker.
- Typing into the search bar will filter through locations

The app is responsive in design and will work on all device sizes.

## Resources
Due to the slight complex nature of the project, I relied heavily on various resources to get me through the project. They are:
